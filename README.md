# projects-made-in-R

These are some of the procjects that I made some years ago in R. These projects bring back fun memories 

[Lund University and the data of published theses](https://pergranberg.netlify.app/post/lund/)<br> 
The fantastic and fun Lund University was where I studied my master in finance and also statistics. In this project I collected the data from [this website](https://lup.lub.lu.se/student-papers/search/student-papers/search/publication?limit=10&sort=year.desc) which have every theses made by students. I analyzed topics such as how many papers are published each year, how many authors are there, which faculty produces the most papers etc. **The plots and project is not refined**, I was going to go back and make it better but it never happend.


[Trends and Analysis of Suicide from WHO](https://pergranberg.netlify.app/post/suicidedata/) <br>
Here I analyzed public data on suicides taken from WHO. It was one intresting topic which is always relevant. Learned a lot about making plots. 

[Analyzing the Rise and Trends of Japanese Anime](https://pergranberg.netlify.app/post/anime/) <br>
By using public data from Kaggle I analyzed data concerning users that watch anime, which is japanese cartoons. 

[Who Plays and Makes Levels in the Nintendo Game Mario Maker?](https://pergranberg.netlify.app/post/mario-maker-analysis/) <br>
I grow up playing Nintendo games so of course I had to analyze data for the game Mario Maker, which lets the players create their own levels! This was a very fun excercise with data wrangling

[Classifying bank customers with Log, Net and Tree](https://pergranberg.netlify.app/post/bankmarketing/) <br>
This was a short project made in Lund University, my task was to try different approaches to classify customers that would default loans. The data is public and was taken from Kaggle.
